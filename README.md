# DC Motor Fault Detection using CNN and Kalman Filter

This repository contains research code and datasets for the detection and classification of open-circuit and short-circuit faults in DC motors using signal processing, Kalman filtering, and CNN-based classification models.

## 📄 Paper Abstract (Work in Progress)
> We propose a hybrid model that combines Kalman Filter for noise reduction and a Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) for real-time fault classification...
